* `~undefined === -1`
* With `a = -~a` you can make an incrementer of `a` just like `a += 1` or `++a`, but with the additional feature that if a has a value of undefined it will get a value of 1 after the first time (Something like it having a default value of 0).
* The Order of insertion for non-integer string properties in an obejct is preserved. See [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5525795/does-javascript-guarantee-object-property-order) for more details.
